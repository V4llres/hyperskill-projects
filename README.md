## Simple Chatty Bot (Java)
A simple bot that will help you in your learning and make it more fun.
https://hyperskill.org/projects/31

**Stage #1 Hello! What’s your name?**
Teach your assistant to introduce itself in the console

**Stage #2: How old are you?**
Use your knowledge of strings and numbers to make the assistant guess your age

**Stage #3: Let’s count!**
Your assistant is old enough to learn how to count. And you are experienced enough to apply the for-loop at this stage!

**Stage #4: The student and the teacher**
At this point, the assistant will be able to check your knowledge and ask multiple choice questions. 
Add some methods to your code and make the stage even better

## Coffee Machine (Java)
Write the software for a simulation of a real-world coffee machine.
https://hyperskill.org/projects/33

**Stage #1 Hello, coffee!**
Write a program that puts basic information on the screen: give the machine a chance to tell the customers what it’s doing!

**Stage #2 Machines have needs**
Program the machine to calculate the amount of ingredients it needs depending on how many people want some coffee.

**Stage #3 Enough coffee for everyone**
Working with conditions, program the machine to estimate how many creamy coffees it can make based on the amount of ingredients we enter.

**Stage #4 Action!**
Upgrade your knowledge of methods - set the machine to perform three basic actions: collect the money, renew the supplies, and serve the coffee.

**Stage #5 On a coffee loop**
Program the machine to display on the screen the amount of supplies left. Set the main loop: now the menu keeps updating until you press exit.

**Stage #6 Brush your code**
Time for some final touch-ups: structure the code so that it runs smoothly.

## Encryption-Decryption (Java)
Developing a command line application which can encrypt/decrypt strings using various encryption algorithms.
https://hyperskill.org/projects/46

**Stage #1 Encrypted**
Learn to input the data and encrypt it, replacing the letters.

**Stage #2 Knowledge is key**
Learn to encrypt messages with a numeric key, using the Caesar cypher. 

**Stage #3 Decrypted!**
Encrypting a message is only half of the deal: now learn to decrypt it as well, using a standard Unicode table.

**Stage #4 I Command you**
Practice working with the command line, using it for passing the mode, the key and the string.

**Stage #5 X-files**
Work with files; learn to store your data in a file.

**Stage #6 Choices, Choices**
Add the possibility to choose a specific encryption algorithm: Ceasar or Unicode.

## Simple Search Engine (Java)
Developing a simple search engine to see if a query exists (or not) within a data set.
https://hyperskill.org/projects/66

**Stage #1 String theory**
Set two strings (where to search and what to search) for the program to return an index of the searched word or report “not found”.

**Stage #2 Expand the search**
With the help of arrays and linear search, add more strings to the program and search for specific data from that input. 

**Stage #3 User menu**
Using switch operator and methods, create a user menu for your search engine.

**Stage #4 X-files**
Enable your search engine to search for data stored in the files.

**Stage #5 Inverted index search**
Working with lists and maps, build the inverted index to enhance your search.

**Stage #6 Search strategies**
Get familiar with patterns and learn to deal with more complex types of search.

## Tic-Tac-Toe (Java)
Developing a version of Tic-Tac-Toe which allows 2 players to play against each other.
https://hyperskill.org/projects/48

**Stage #1 Welcome to the battlefield!**
To start things off, the program needs to be able to print any state of the field. You’ll write a serious multi-line program using a lot of prints. 

**Stage #2 User is a gamemaster**
Now it’s time to analyze user input and print the state of the field depending on it. You’ll learn to address specific positions in a string to achieve the required outcome.

**Stage #3 What's up on a field?**
Now we’re going to write a fully-functioning multi-line program that responds to the user’s actions and analyzes the state of the field. Not only will it tell you who is winning, but it will also determine if the situation on a given field is theoretically possible!

**Stage #4 First move!**
Tic-tac-toe is not all about analysis – a game is meant to be played! Write a program that can change the state of the field, as your first real step toward a fully-functioning game application! 

**Stage #5 Fight!**
Finally! Thanks to this app, you can always challenge a friend to play a quick game of Tic-Tac-Toe!

## Flashcards
Developing an application which allows flashcards to be created and used for remembering definitions of terms.
https://hyperskill.org/projects/44

**Stage #1 Stage one, card one**
Display information about a single card on the screen.

**Stage #2 What's on the card?**
Compare the lines and work with conditions: display the card and the user’s answer on the screen.

**Stage #3 Make it your own**
Practice arrays and loops: create a new card for the program to play with you.

**Stage #4 A good stack**
Learn to use hashtables, display key values and work with exceptions in order to fix the problem of repeating cards.

**Stage #5 Menu, please!**
Work with files: create a menu that allows to add, delete, save and upload saved cards in your game.

**Stage #6 Statistics**
Using statistics, set a correct answer for each card and teach the game to determine which card was the hardest to solve.

**Stage 7 IMPORTant**
Enable the user to import files right upon starting the game, working with command-line arguments. 

## Readability Score
Developing a program that can identify the difficulty of a piece of text and identify the suitable reading age.
https://hyperskill.org/projects/39

**Stage 1 Simple estimatation**
Input a phrase or a sentence for the program to determine its difficulty level based on the symbol count.

**Stage 2 Words and sentences**
Apply your knowledge of advanced strings, arrays and regular expressions: determine how difficult the text is judging by the average count of words in the sentences.

**Stage 3 Score!**
Add a readability score based on a special formula: it will estimate the difficulty levels of larger bodies of texts uploaded from a file.

**Stage 4 More parameters**
More parameters can be taken into account: for example, you can consider syllables and letters. Enable the program to base its estimation on those parameters altogether.

## Numeral System Converter
A program to convert between different numeral systems such as binary, decimal, fractional.
https://hyperskill.org/projects/41

**Stage 1 For example**
Start with outputs and the binary system: print a line with an example conversion.

**Stage 2 Almost an octopus**
Learn the basics of working with Scanner class: teach the converter to determine the last digit of the octal number, converted from the decimal system.

**Stage 3 Convert decimals**
With the help of switch operator and prefixes, convert the number to any system of your choice.

**Stage 4 Any which radix**
Upgrade your converter: enable it to convert numbers from and to any numeral system. Practice arrays, loops and strings.

**Stage 5 Converting fractions**
Make it possible for the converter to work with fractions as well (that is, float and double datatypes).

**Stage 6 Error!**
Mistakes are inevitable: teach your converter to handle them and report errors if they occur.
